            <p>
                We take claims of copyright infringement seriously. We will respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement that comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the “DMCA”) or
                any other applicable intellectual property legislation or laws. Responses may include removing, blocking or disabling access to material claimed to be the subject of infringing
                activity, terminating the user’s access to Nftforadults ), or all of the foregoing.
            </p>
            <p>
                <br />
            </p>
            <p>
                If you believe any material accessible on Nftforadults infringes your copyright, you may submit a copyright infringement notification (see below, “Filing a DMCA Notice of Copyright
                Infringement” for instructions on filing such a notice). These requests should only be submitted by the copyright owner or an agent authorized to act on the owner’s behalf.
            </p>
            <p>
                <br />
            </p>
            <p>
                If we remove or disable access to material in response to such a notice, we will take reasonable steps to notify the user that uploaded the affected content material that we have
                removed or disabled access to so that the user has the opportunity to submit a counter notification (see below, “Counter-Notification Procedures” for instructions on filing a counter
                notification). It is our policy to document all notices of alleged infringement on which we act.
            </p>
            <p>
                <br />
            </p>
            <p>
                All copyright infringement notifications and counter-notifications must be written in English. Any attempted notifications written in foreign languages or using foreign characters may,
                at our discretion, be deemed non-compliant and disregarded.

            <p>
                If you choose to request removal of content by submitting an infringement notification, please remember that you are initiating a legal process. Do not make false claims. Misuse of
                this process may result in the suspension of your account or other legal consequences.

                <br />
            </p>
            <p>In accordance with the DMCA, the written notice (the “DMCA Notice”) must include substantially the following:</p>
            <p>
                <br />
            </p>
            <p>Identification of the copyrighted work you believe to have been infringed or, if the claim involves multiple works, a representative list of such works.</p>
            <p>
                Identification of the material you believe to be infringing in a sufficiently precise manner to allow us to locate that material. If your complaint does not contain the specific URL of
                the video you believe infringes your rights, we may be unable to locate and remove it. General information about the video, such as a channel URL or username, is typically not
                adequate. Please include the URL(s) of the exact video(s).
            </p>
            <p>
                Adequate information by which we, and the uploader(s) of any video(s) you remove, can contact you (including your name, postal address, telephone number and, if available, e-mail
                address).
            </p>
            <p>A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the copyrighted material is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent or the law..</p>
            <p>
                A statement that the information in the written notice is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are the owner, or an agent authorized to act on behalf of the owner, of an
                exclusive right that is allegedly infringed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Complete complaints require the physical or electronic signature of the copyright owner or a representative authorized to act on their behalf. To satisfy this requirement, you may type
                your full legal name to act as your signature at the bottom of your complaint.

            <p>Your name, address, phone number and physical or electronic signature;</p>
            <p>Identification of the allegedly infringing content and its location before removal or access to it was disabled;</p>
            <p>A statement under penalty of perjury that you believe in good faith that the content was removed by mistake or misidentification; and</p>
            <p>
                A statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the U.S. Federal District Court for the judicial district in which you are located (or if you are outside the U.S., for any judicial
                district in which the operator of XXX may be found), and that you will accept service of process from the person who originally provided us with the DMCA Notice or an agent of such
                person.
            </p>
            <p>We will not respond to counter notifications that do not meet the requirements above.</p>

            <p>
                After we receive your Counter Notice, we will forward it to the party who submitted the original DMCA Notice and inform that party that the removed material may be restored after 10
                business days but no later than 14 business days from the date we received your Counter Notice, unless our Designated Agent first receives notice from the party who filed the original
                DMCA Notice informing us that such party has filed a court action to restrain you from engaging in infringing activity related to the material in question.
